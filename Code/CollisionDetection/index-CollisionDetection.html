        <h2>Infinite Line against Circle</h2>
        This example showcases the simplest case I know of to test for a collision between an infinite line
        and a circle.
        <br>
        I originally found this to be really unintuitive trying to discover this without any guide to a solution.
        <br><br>
        In my mind this is one of many examples of the magic of computers to create illusions.
        In this case, it is an illusion of objects 'touching' one another and registering it with rigorous mathematical
        precision. I love collision algorithms tested against simplified abstract models of geometric primitives because
        they are in essence 'perfect'. The only limit to the precision is the precision of your instantiation of numerical
        precision.
        <br><br>
        Here the red line is the line we are testing for a collision.
        <br><br>
        The white line and green lines are both drawn for purposes of understanding the collision detection method.
        <br>
        The white line is a line drawn from an arbitrary point (start or end) of the red line.
        <br>
        The green line is a projected line from the circle down to the red line.
        <br><br>

        The simple magic of this method is that all you must do to detect a collision is check if the length
        of the green line is less(or equal) than the radius of the circle.

        <h2>Line Segment against Circle</h2>
        This example is a more common use case, and probably more useful than the above example.
        <br>
        The implementation is almost identical but to find success we must take a few steps back from where we ended.
        <br><br>
        The only real change we need to make is to derrive and apply the parametric line equation instead of
        simply projecting to the point of the line regardless of it's length.
        <br>
        We can determine the distance we are along the line and clamp the projected length to be between this length
        and 0 and we have perfect collision detection between a line and a circle!
